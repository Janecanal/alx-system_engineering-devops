Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 2024-03-08 13:00 UTC to 2024-03-09 03:00 UTC.
Impact: The service experiencing downtime was our primary web application, affecting 80% of our users. Users reported inability to log in and access critical features, leading to a significant drop in user engagement.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to incorrect routing of traffic and subsequent service degradation.
Timeline:

13:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high latency and increased error rates.
13:15 UTC: Engineering team notified of the issue by monitoring system.
13:30 UTC: Investigation began, focusing on backend services and database performance. Initial assumption was on database overload due to increased traffic.
14:30 UTC: Misleading investigation paths explored included database optimizations and scaling up server resources.
15:00 UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further analysis and resolution.
02:00 UTC: Root cause identified as misconfiguration in load balancer settings.
03:00 UTC: Issue resolved by correcting load balancer configuration and restoring normal traffic routing.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to incorrect routing of traffic, causing service degradation and downtime.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to ensure proper routing of traffic to backend services.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Regular review and validation of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Implementation of automated testing for load balancer configurations to catch errors before deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any inconsistencies.
Implement automated testing scripts for load balancer configurations to ensure correctness before deployment.
By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability of our services.
